        <h1>Research Interests</h1>

        <p>
          I'm interested in AI safety, and in building robust and reliable machine learning systems.
          Some topics I have worked on include:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06262">Generative models</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11814">Geometric deep learning</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07210">Causal inference</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04405">Uncertainty quantification</a></li>
          </ul>
          Within these topics, I'm particularly on the lookout for methodology that practitioners can apply under minimal assumptions, with a view towards complex and safety-critical settings where more complex assumptions may be difficult to justify.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also interested in developing better tools for describing and reasoning about AI systems themselves.
          At present, the mathematical language we use in AI research is often far removed from the actual code we end up implementing.
          This complicates the development process, limits automation, and makes it difficult to reason about correctness.
          I'm interested in using tools from applied category theory, programming languages, logic, and proof assistants (e.g. Lean) improve on this.
          For example, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14993">this talk</a>, I describe a line of work that uses categorical probability to obtain novel methodology for parameterising stochastically group equivariant neural networks.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any of our interests overlap, I'd love to hear from you!
        </p>

        <h1>Background</h1>

        <p>I'm currently a Florence Nightingale Bicentenary Research Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. I previously completed a postdoc with <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/">Chris Holmes</a> and <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/">Arnaud Doucet</a> working on conformal inference and causal machine learning. Before that I completed my DPhil as part of the <a href="http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS CDT</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/">Arnaud Doucet</a> and <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/">George Deligiannidis</a>. My thesis covered several topics in (primarily) Bayesian machine learning, including Monte Carlo methods and deep generative modelling. Before they left Oxford, I also worked with <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Frank Wood</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hongseokyang/home">Hongseok Yang</a> on topics in probabilistic programming.</p>
